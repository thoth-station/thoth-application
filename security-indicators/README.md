# Thoth Security Indicators

This is a standalone ArgoCD Application for Thoth's Security Indicators. It is meant to be deployed into a separate OpenShift
Project, therefore it is not references from the `kustomization.yaml` file at the root directory of this
repository.

The deployment generated by kustomize can be evaluated against Open Policy Agent policies
using: `kustomize build --enable_alpha_plugins overlays/test | conftest test --policy ../policy -`.
